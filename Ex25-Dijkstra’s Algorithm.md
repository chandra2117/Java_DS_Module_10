# Ex25 Finding the Fastest Route to a Charging Station using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
## DATE:
## AIM:
To design and implement a java program that helps an electric vehicle (EV) find the shortest travel time from its current block to the nearest charging station using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.
## Algorithm

## Output:



## Result:
The program has been successfully implemented and executed.
It uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest travel time from the EV’s current location to the nearest charging station and correctly handles cases where no station is reachable.
